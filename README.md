## Features
üåæ **New Farming Experience**

Eliminating repetitive crops and providing detailed planting guides for special crops.
Based on the "Four Major Agricultures" of the real world, the agricultural gameplay is enriched to make farming more than just "planting."

---
üí∞ **Complete Economy and Currency System**

Villagers are no longer just decorations! In multiplayer games, players can trade goods or currency through the market.
Trade is no longer just an economic theory but an essential part of life and the game.
Reconnect the world through trade and economy.

---
üí§ **Relaxing but Not Empty Leisure Pack**

"Does a leisure pack have to have no goals?" Absolutely not!
There are no mandatory goals or hard requirements to progress through technology, but there is a "final challenge"‚Äîsimilar to the "star collection" in the All the Mods series.
You can:
- Focus on achieving the ultimate goal
- Take a break and relax
- Build your own city-state
- Create your own Jurassic Park
- Become a master chef and cook all the food
- Be a busy waiter, shuttling between the kitchen and customers
- Or just be a farmer and enjoy the simple and honest moments

üõ† **Mod Selection Philosophy**

Following the idea of "They are great, but they don't belong here," this modpack does not include too many adventure and combat mods.
In terms of cooking mods, I chose "Farmer's Delight," but did not add other excellent works like Let's Do series, cooking pots, or tea-sharing mods.
Although they have excellent mechanisms, they have a high degree of overlap with the existing content, require additional adaptation and modification, and may bring unpredictable compatibility issues.
The only exception is "Let's Do Vinery," which is used to complete the missing wine-making system in Farmer's Delight.

---
üç≤ **Farming + Simulation Management**

It can be understood as a combination of **Stardew Valley** and **Touhou Mystia's Izakaya**:
You can manage a farm and also run a restaurant as a shop owner, allowing you to switch freely between being a farmer and a business owner.

## Configuration Notes

 1. **Distant Horizons**  
According to tests, this modpack is fully compatible with Distant Horizons 2.3.4-b. However, after entering the world, there will be a world rendering time of 40 minutes to 3 hours based on the render distance (the screen will be black during this time).
Solution: Disable "Enable Rendering" in the settings and reduce the LOD render block radius to reduce the time.

 2. **FancyMenu**  
To add main menu music: `config\fancymenu\assets`, audio files need to be in `.ogg` format.
To add slides: `config\fancymenu\slideshows\slideshows_1\images`, images need to be in `.png` format and named as `image_xxx.png`.

 3. **ReTerraForged**  
**Warning**: This mod has poor compatibility and is highly customizable. Before playing, ensure your configuration is correct and that you are not loading mods that severely conflict with it (most terrain mods conflict with it).

 4. **Create**  
**Warning**: Due to API changes in Create version 6.0+, many mods that are no longer updated are incompatible with the API. The highest supported version currently is Create 0.5.1.j.
